## General Information
- **Project Description**: This project aims to enhance an image classification model to improve its accuracy and generalization capabilities. The focus is on mitigating underfitting and overfitting issues by employing data augmentation techniques and addressing class imbalances.
- **Background**: Initially, the model exhibited poor performance with indications of underfitting and overfitting. The goal was to improve the model’s learning efficiency and robustness by utilizing data augmentation and class rebalancing techniques.
- **Business Problem**: The project addresses the problem of inaccurate image classification due to model inefficiencies and class imbalances, which can lead to biased or incorrect predictions in real-world applications.
- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of various classes of images stored in a structured directory format, with augmentation applied to balance the number of samples per class.

## Conclusions
- **Conclusion 1**: The application of data augmentation strategies has significantly improved the model’s training and validation accuracy.
- **Conclusion 2**: Addressing class imbalance through augmentation has resulted in a more robust model with better generalization to unseen data.
- **Conclusion 3**: The model’s loss metrics have decreased, indicating that it is learning effectively without overfitting to the training data.
- **Conclusion 4**: Overall, the enhancements have led to a model that performs well across all classes, mitigating previous issues of underfitting and overfitting.
