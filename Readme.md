## General Information
- **Project Description**: This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model to accurately detect melanoma from images. Melanoma is a severe form of skin cancer, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment.
- **Background**: Melanoma accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths, making it one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Early and accurate detection can significantly reduce the mortality rate. This project focuses on creating a solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists to the presence of melanoma, thereby reducing the manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- **Business Problem**: The manual process of diagnosing melanoma from skin lesion images is time-consuming and prone to human error. An automated system can assist dermatologists by providing quick and accurate assessments, improving diagnostic efficiency and potentially saving lives.
- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of labeled images of skin lesions, including both melanoma and non-melanoma cases. Data augmentation techniques have been applied to balance the classes and improve model performance.

## Conclusions
- **Conclusion 1**: Data augmentation has significantly enhanced the model's ability to generalize, reducing overfitting and improving accuracy.
- **Conclusion 2**: Class rebalancing through augmentation has ensured that the model performs well across all classes, addressing the issue of class imbalance.
- **Conclusion 3**: The improved model shows lower loss values, indicating effective learning and better prediction accuracy.
- **Conclusion 4**: The enhanced CNN model can effectively assist dermatologists by providing accurate melanoma detection, thereby improving diagnostic workflows and potentially saving lives.
